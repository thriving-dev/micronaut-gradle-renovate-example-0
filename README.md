Micronaut gradle project with automated dependency updates by renovate that _actually_ updates the micronaut runtime used.

TLDR: Projects created via [Micronaut Launch](https://micronaut.io/launch) define the micronaut version to be used in the `gradle.properties` file which is not discoverable by renovate.
Further, switching from the properties file to [version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:central-declaration-of-dependencies) the version also is not discoverable/resolvable by renovate.
